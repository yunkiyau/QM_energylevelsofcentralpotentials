# Quantum Energy Levels in Central Potentials

This repository contains a single MATLAB script that models the first few quantum energy levels of central potential wells using the finite difference method. I did this as part of an assignment for my senior Advanced Quantum Physics course. The assignment also required creation of Finite square well models with and without spinâ€“orbit coupling (SOC) which I have not included so that future students do not have access to the solution if a similar assignent is given again. The code computes the energy levels of:

- **Harmonic Oscillator**  
- **Infinite Square Well**  

These examples should give students a good idea on how other models can be computed. Please reach out to me at yunki.yau@gmail.com if you need more assistance and I would be happy to help. 

## How it works
- Constructs the kinetic energy operator using finite differences.  
- Builds the potential energy matrix for each potential.  
- Solves for the lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using MATLAB's sparse eigensolver (`eigs`).  
- Plots the resulting energy levels for comparison.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2022a or later (earlier versions may work).  
- No toolboxes beyond base MATLAB are required.  

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the script:

```matlab
quantum_central_potentials.m
```

This will compute and display the lowest energy levels for the harmonic oscillator and the infinite square well.
